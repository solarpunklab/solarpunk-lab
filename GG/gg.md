In the early 1970’s, Liz Christy and her group of green-thumbed vigilantes called the Green Guerrillas decided to take matters into their own hands, and started out on a mission to transform their New York City neighborhood into a more psychologically healthy place.

They threw “seed bombs” over the fences of vacant lots, planted sunflowers in the center meridians of streets, put flower boxes in the windows of abandoned buildings, and started a large community garden in an empty lot. 
Soon, their project began to gain momentum: local nurseries donated clippings and seeds, volunteers came to lend a hand, and as the grassroots movement grew, community gardens began appearing all throughout the city.

Guerrilla gardening is the act of cultivating plants in a public place, usually in a spot that is not otherwise being cared for, often with the aim of improving the surroundings and protecting the environment. 
It’s direct action against nature deprivation and depletion — highlighting the issue of biophobic urbanisation while fighting it. It’s anarchic, in the purest sense, and is challenging the status quo of what we’ve been taught cities should look like, and who can have the power and right to shape them.

Seed Bombs are made of clay, soil, and seeds. These little balls of clay use a planting technique that is actually hundreds of years old.  The clay protects the seeds from hungry insects and birds, while the soil provides organic matter and nutrients. 

When conditions are right (water, temperature, sunlight), the seed bombs will break down and the seeds will germinate into flowering plants that will provide habitat and food for our important pollinator friends. 

Seed Bombs should not actually be buried in soil. They need to be placed (or dropped) on the soil surface. These plants will grow best in full to partial sun – in a spot that receives at least 4 hours of sun daily.

Store Seed Bombs in a cool, dry place. They will keep for months without much loss of germination.
